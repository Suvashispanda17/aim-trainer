ðŸŽ¯ Project Showcase: Python Aim Trainer Game ðŸŽ®

Excited to share my recent Python projectâ€”a dynamic Aim Trainer Game built using the Pygame library! This interactive game is designed to test and improve reflexes and accuracy. Key features include:

Dynamic Targets: Targets grow and shrink to add complexity.
Real-Time Feedback: Displays hits, misses, speed (targets per second), and time elapsed.
Game Over Summary: Provides insights like accuracy, total hits, and speed after the game ends.
Custom Graphics: Smooth animations and a top-bar UI for real-time stats.
This project challenged my skills in event handling, animations, and real-time performance tracking. It was both a fun and educational experience.

ðŸ“Œ Technologies: Python, Pygame
ðŸ’¡ Key Concepts: Object-Oriented Programming, Graphics Rendering, Event Handling
